# Sentiment_Analysis


In this project, I have fetched real-time tweets and cleaned raw data ready using Python regex expressions.
The main goal of the project is to discover if the text in the tweets is either positive, negative or neutral using TextBlob library.
These trends were visualized using matplotlib in the form of easy to interpret bar graphs.
